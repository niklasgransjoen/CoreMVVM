# CoreMVVM

A simple, lightweight [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) library for [.NET Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_.NET_libraries_and_frameworks#.NET_Standard) made with [Inversion of Control (IoC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) in mind, with no external dependencies<sup>1</sup>!

#### But why?

There are countless IoC and MVVM libraries out there, yet I decided to make my own. The main reason was that I wanted to know and understand exactly what sort of black magic takes place behind the IoC pattern. And I recommend you do the same at least once, before moving on to more reliable, tried-and-true libraries.

#### Credits

This project was inspired by Thomas Freudenberg's [TinyLittleMVVM](https://github.com/thoemmi/TinyLittleMvvm), which is based on the same idea of a lightweight MVVM library.
